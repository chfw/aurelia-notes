# Aurelia Notes


## Preface

These notes comes from you and me. If the collected and doctored notes would
save you an hour, tell me and I will be glad.


## Introduction

**Aurelia** is an emerging MVC framework to compete against Angular version 2. The
aurelia community felt calm towards React, Vue.js though. Because there lacks of
documentation, similar to Angular 1 in 2012, it is hard to find what you want
in once place. Hence, this note try to address the gap.


## Bias

All my notes are based on [webpack+typescript version of Aurelia](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/tree/master/skeleton-typescript-webpack).

Have not thought about it yet. I may turn it into a book if the content attracts
good audience.
