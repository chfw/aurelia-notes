# Documentation tools

A list of tools have been evaluated for documenting aurelia+typscript based projects:

1. typedoc
1. esdoc + esdoc typescript plugin
1. tsdoc
1. [compodoc](https://github.com/compodoc/compodoc)

The evaluation requirement is: one command, and get me the documentation please.

Only compodoc does the documention job nicely without a piece of complaint. Other three
tools do not do the job as simple as the requirement is. Do not waste your time using
those three.
